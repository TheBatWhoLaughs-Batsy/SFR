// ── Per-cell values, focused or not ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE function producing the number every plan-view cell is coloured by, used
// by buildCscanGrid (which draws them) and by computeGridScales (which sets the
// colour limits from them). They used to call gatedIntensity separately; with
// focusing in the picture that duplication would mean the grid could be drawn
// with values the scale was not computed from, which is silently a wrong image
// rather than a crash.
//
// FOCUSING IS PER ROW, and only along the row. A C-scan row is a line of
// positions at one height, which is exactly the geometry lib/saft.js's
// back-projection assumes; rows are focused independently of each other and
// never contribute across rows. That is deliberate rather than a simplification
// -- CLAUDE.md's 2026-08-30 rover diagnosis measured the vertical axis to be a
// completely different animal from the horizontal one (moving 200 mm sideways
// costs a few dB of background correlation, moving 150 mm up destroys it
// entirely, because the standoff walks ~10 mm), so summing across rows would be
// combining traces that do not describe the same wall.
//
// Neighbours are addressed by GRID COLUMN, not by position in the array, so a
// row with holes in it (an undone cell, a partial raster) still gets the right
// spacing instead of closing the gap up.
//
// `focusMethod` picks the kernel: 'saft' (default) is the incoherent,
// magnitude-domain back-projection above; 'das_cf' and 'dmas_cf' are coherent
// (phase-aware) alternatives from lib/saft.js, weighted by a coherence factor
// CF^focusGamma that suppresses depths where the aperture disagrees. They need
// a complex range profile per trace (built here from h_cal, windowed exactly
// like the live display) rather than the magnitude profile SAFT reads.
//

// and sits 20-30 dB above its neighbours, so letting it into an aperture would
// smear that error across every cell within half an aperture of it.

// so the operator tunes one constant here plus the projector's own zoom and the
// image lands on the real geometry. A fitted scale would silently re-scale
// whenever the window or the pane split changed, which is exactly what makes an
// aligned projection drift.

// from the canvas instead, every pane change would slide the projected image.
