// Continuous rover raster: position track + along-row sweep binning.
//
// The stepped raster asks "drive to the cell, stop, settle, take N sweeps".
// That flow was built when a sweep took 550 ms, so any motion during one
// smeared it across frequency and stopping was the only option. At 27.5 ms a
// sweep the constraint has inverted, and the whole per-cell overhead -- the
// 500 ms arrival gate, the settle, the discarded in-flight sweep -- is now
// ~93% of the time spent. Continuous motion deletes all of it AND hands back
// free coherent averaging, because several sweeps land inside one cell.
//
// SMEAR IS NOT THE LIMIT ANY MORE. A sweep steps frequency sequentially, so
// motion during one is a phase error bilinear in (step index, velocity):
//   * the LINEAR term is range-Doppler coupling, an apparent range SHIFT of
//     (f_start/B) * D * sin(theta) ~= 0.65 * D, where D is the distance moved
//     during the 20.9 ms RF window (51 steps x NIOS_MIN_DWELL=4096 samples at
//     10 Msps -- note that is the per-STEP dwell, not RX_BUFFER_SAMPLES=2048,
//     which is the host-driven path's DMA granularity). At 150 mm/s, the X
//     axis maximum, D = 3.1 mm and the shift is 2.0 mm against a 50 mm range
//     cell. It is zero at broadside.
//   * the QUADRATIC term is the actual defocus, and it reaches 0.39 rad at
//     150 mm/s against the ~0.79 rad (pi/4) where defocus starts to matter.
// Both are comfortably inside budget at any speed this rail can reach. At the
// old 550 ms sweep the quadratic term was 3.4 rad at 50 mm/s, which is why the
// rig had to stop.
//
// WHAT IS THE LIMIT is spatial sampling, and it is one number:
//
//     sweep spacing = v * T_sweep        (27.5 ms at the shipped NIOS sweep)
//
// so 0.69 mm at 25 mm/s, 2.75 mm at 100, 4.12 mm at 150. A grid pitch finer
// than that leaves empty cells however long the scan runs -- the sweeps were
// never taken. Note also that pitch, speed and averaging depth are ONE
// resource, not three: sweeps/cell = pitch / (v * T_sweep). Pick two.
//
// And finer is not better past a point: spatial Nyquist for the imaging is
// dx <= lambda_min/(4 sin(theta_max)), i.e. 15-21 mm at 5 GHz, so 5 mm already
// carries 3x margin. Below that, halving the pitch buys no resolution and
// costs 3 dB of per-cell SNR, because it splits the same sweeps across twice
// as many cells.
//
// TIME BASE. A position is only as good as the time it is labelled with, and
// the only thing that knows when a position was MEASURED is the board: every
// status frame carries `ms`, its own clock (the step ISR's tick count -- the
// same clock that generates the steps). The Pi forwards it as
// rover_status.board_ms beside last_status_at, the Pi's time of RECEIPT.
//
// Receipt is not measurement. The R4's WiFi delivers frames late and in
// bursts, and a frame processed after a stall in rover_server's board loop is
// stamped later still. Keying the track on receipt bent the x-vs-time curve
// wherever that happened. Measured on three 2026-09-13 exports: half of all
// empty cells had neighbours ONE sweep apart that had been placed 5+ mm apart,
// and one ~1.3 s stall piled 43 sweeps into a single cell and left the next 30
// columns empty.
//
// So the track is keyed on BOARD time, and a sweep -- stamped on the Pi's clock
// by sfcw_result.timestamp -- is converted onto it by createBoardClock below.
// That conversion is one line fitted over a 30 s window, never a per-frame
// offset, so link jitter cannot reach the positions at all. Neither side ever
// touches performance.now(), which would fold two websocket latencies in.
//
// A Pi or firmware that sends no board_ms falls back to receipt time: the old
// behaviour, holes and all. The panel's row readout says when that happens.
//
// What remains is a single constant: a sweep is stamped ~14 ms AFTER its own
// phase centre, and the clock fit places a measurement one MINIMUM link delay
// (a few ms) after it happened rather than at zero. Their difference is the
// caller's `latencyMs` -- one scalar per speed, default 0,
// and measurable from an out-and-back pass over one row, where the spatial lag
// between the two directions is exactly 2*v*tau. It is a BIAS, not noise: its
// sign follows the direction of travel, so in a snake it displaces alternate
// rows oppositely and a straight feature comes out as a zigzag of 2*v*tau.
// Nothing in the pipeline combines rows coherently today (C-scan focusing is
// per row, SAR treats the capture as one line), so its only effect is that
// zigzag in the plan view -- but it is why the field exists.

// Rover status arrives at ~11 Hz (the firmware aims for 20; WiFi latency in
// the R4's socket stack is the suspect). 600 samples is ~55 s of history --
// comfortably more than one row at any usable speed, which is all the binning
// ever looks back over.

/**
 * Maps Pi wall-clock time onto the rover board's clock.
 *
 * Every status frame gives one pair: when the board measured it (board
 * seconds) and when the Pi received it (Pi seconds). Their difference is the
 * clock offset PLUS that frame's transit delay, and a delay can only ever be
 * positive. So the offset is not the average of the differences -- that carries
 * the average delay, stalls and all -- but their LOWER boundary: the frames that
 * happened to cross fastest.
 *
 * The boundary is a line, not a constant, because two oscillators never run at
 * exactly the same rate. It is fitted the standard way for one-way delay
 * measurements (Moon, Skelly & Towsley, 1999): take the lower convex hull of the
 * points, and of its edges the one spanning the window's mean time, which is the
 * line lying under every point with the least total gap. A delayed frame,
 * however late, lies above the hull and changes nothing. That is the whole
 * robustness argument, and why a 1 s stall that wrecked receipt-timed positions
 * does not move this fit at all.
 *
 * Accuracy is set by the fastest frames, not the typical ones: the mapping
 * lands one MINIMUM link delay after truth, a constant that the raster's
 * latency setting absorbs like every other fixed offset.
