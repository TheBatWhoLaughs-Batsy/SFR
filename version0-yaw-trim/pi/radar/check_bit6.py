"""Does config_gpio bit 6 (dsp_path_en) reach the FPGA, and does it read back?

    python3 radar/check_bit6.py

Run on the Pi with the services STOPPED (it needs the device to itself).
Nothing is streamed; it only pokes the config-GPIO register:

    1. prints the FPGA version and, where libbladeRF supports it, whether the
       running image came from HOST (bladeRF-cli -l / libbladeRF autoload) or
       FLASH (the board's own autoload)
    2. reads config_gpio
    3. writes it back with bit 12 set (LED bit -- reads back on EVERY image)
       and checks bit 12 returns: proves the write path host -> FX3 -> Nios ->
       PIO and the read path back
    4. writes it back with bit 6 set and checks bit 6 returns: on the v10
       image (readback of nios_gpo_slv(6) added 2026-09-11) it does; on v9 and
       earlier the readback has no bit 6 and it reads 0 whatever was written
    5. restores the original value

Verdict table:

    bit 12 does not read back      -> the write (or the read) is not reaching
                                      the Nios at all; host/USB/Nios problem
    bit 12 ok, bit 6 reads 0       -> the loaded image is older than v10
                                      (typically the board's flash image
                                      after a power cycle): load the current
                                      one, from the repo root:
                                      bladeRF-cli -l fpga/images/hostedxA9_niosIIf_sweep_dsp_v15_fifo256_signaltap.rbf
    bit 12 ok, bit 6 reads 1       -> the write lands and v10+ is running; if
                                      the FX3 still delivers raw samples the
                                      fault is inside the FPGA between
                                      nios_gpo_slv(6) and the rx.vhd mux
