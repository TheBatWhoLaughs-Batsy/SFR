# Master quick-tune table: covers the whole usable band at a fixed grid, generated
# once per device connection. Any sweep's start/stop/step is snapped onto this grid

# "Quick-tune master table" for the history of why this replaced per-grid caching.

# bladerf_get_quick_tune() isn't a stateless read — every call WRITES a new fastlock
# profile into a fixed-size on-device table (bladerf2.c: board_data->quick_tune_tx/
# rx_profile, capped at NUM_BBP_FASTLOCK_PROFILES). That counter only resets on a
# full device close+reopen. Past the cap, bladerf_get_quick_tune() returns an error
# and leaves the profile struct unpopulated — MAX_QUICK_TUNE_PROFILES here must stay
# under that hardware ceiling or the table silently contains garbage profiles for
# every frequency past it (this happened: a prior 1-6 GHz/10 MHz table needed 501
# profiles against a 256 cap).

# Settle is gated on wall time since the retune, not on a count of delivered RX
# buffers -- see the long comment in _sweep_core. After the time gate the loop
# drains until a buffer arrives in LOCKSTEP with the hardware, which is what
# distinguishes "the hardware just produced this" from "this was sitting in the
# ring". MAX_BACKLOG_DRAIN bounds that at more than the 16-deep ring so a
# pathological stall cannot hang a sweep.
#
# The lockstep test is TWO-SIDED and that is the whole point. Let lag(n) be a
# buffer's queueing delay, T(n) its arrival: gap(n) = BP + lag(n) - lag(n-1). So
# the gap measures the CHANGE in staleness, and BOTH directions mean stale:
#   gap >> BP  the RX thread was descheduled and has just delivered the OLDEST
#              buffer in the ring -- lag jumped up by (gap - BP). This is the
#              stalest buffer available, and a one-sided `gap >= 0.5*BP` test
#              accepted it as proof of freshness. Inverted, and it was the bug.
#   gap << BP  the ring is non-empty, so sync_rx returns immediately and the gap
#              is just deinterleave time -- backlog being drained, also stale.
# Only gap ~= BP means lag did not change, and lag can only sit at its floor
# there, because a non-empty ring cannot produce a full-period gap.
# Measured 2026-09-05 over 172,901 buffers under full-stack load: 96.4% of gaps
# land in [0.9, 1.1]*BP and a >1.5*BP gap is followed by a <0.5*BP one 80.7% of
# the time -- the stall/drain signature, textbook. [0.8, 1.2] keeps 97.5%, so
# rejecting the rest costs one extra buffer wait on ~2.5% of steps.
#
# Do NOT replace this with a cumulative lag estimate (lag += gap - BP, clamped at
# 0). Tried: mean gap measures 0.4097 ms against a nominal 0.4096, and that 24 ppm
# accumulates to a 19 ms phantom lag within seconds. The gap band is drift-free
# because it never integrates.
# MAX_BACKLOG_DRAIN is DELIBERATELY NOT a cap on the drain loop any more -- see
# the long comment at the drain in _sweep_core. Capping the drain by a COUNT and
# then capturing anyway on exhaustion was the residual-corruption path (fixed
# 2026-09-06). It is kept only as the reference "how deep can the backlog
# legitimately be" figure: libbladeRF's ring is 16 buffers, so anything past this
# is a starvation burst rather than ordinary backlog.
MAX_BACKLOG_DRAIN = 24
# Wall-clock budget for reaching lockstep after the settle deadline. The drain is
# bounded by this instead of by a buffer count, because a late buffer is still at
# the correct frequency (the retune already happened) while an unproven one may

# RX buffer geometry. These are TWO different numbers on purpose -- see below.
#
# RX_BUFFER_SAMPLES is how many samples per channel one RX buffer delivers, and
# it sets the clock the whole settle gate is expressed in: at settle_count = 0 a
# step waits one buffer period before the capture and then captures one, so the
# per-step cost is 2 * RX_BUFFER_SAMPLES / sample_rate. Halving it from 4096 to
# 2048 is worth 0.41 ms/step = 21 ms on a 51-step sweep (85.6 -> ~65 ms).
#
# It MUST stay an exact divisor-multiple of the DMA buffer libbladeRF is
# configured with in bladerf_driver.py's sync_config (buffer_size=4096), and
# that is the whole reason the demod length is a separate constant. _rx_loop_dual
# asks sync_rx for RX_BUFFER_SAMPLES * 2 (RX_X2 counts the request as the total
# across both channels), so the request is 4096 -- exactly one DMA buffer, the
# same clean alignment 4096/8192 had.
#
# What happens without that alignment is not subtle and it is what killed an
# earlier attempt to set this to 2000 directly. sync_rx serves a request out of
# whole DMA buffers and carries the remainder forward, so a request that does not
# divide the DMA buffer leaves a leftover that GROWS by (DMA - request) every
# call: at 4000 against 4096 the leftover walks 96 samples per call until, 43
# calls later, a request is served entirely from leftover and returns instantly.
# The data stays contiguous, so this is invisible to any correctness check -- but
# the returned samples end up to a full buffer period BEHIND the arrival that
# delivered them, and the arrival time is the only thing the settle gate can see.
# The gate reasons "this buffer arrived at T >= t_retune + buf_period, so its
# contents cover [T - buf_period, T], which starts at or after the retune". Under
# a walking leftover that reasoning is false by up to a whole period, so the
# capture straddles or entirely precedes the retune and holds the PREVIOUS
# frequency's IQ. Measured: S_repeat 33.8/36.6 dB -> 21.3/17.5 dB and 4/7
# corrupted sweeps per 1199 -> 183/233. That is far too large to be the ~3 dB of
# processing gain lost by shortening the correlation, and it is why the fix is
# alignment, not a longer settle.
#
# All of this was confirmed by direct measurement (SFCW_DIAG, 2026-09-06) before
# this pair of constants was chosen:
#   - DMA quantum: at n=2000 the dominant RX gap sits at 0.2046-0.2048 ms, NOT
#     the 0.2000 ms buf_period computes -- 0.2048 ms is exactly 2048 samples per
#     channel, so sync_config's buffer_size=4096 counts TOTAL samples in RX_X2
#     and the quantum is 2048/channel. RX_BUFFER_SAMPLES must therefore be a
#     multiple of 2048. Only 28.2% of gaps fell within 2% of the computed
#     buf_period, against 79.3% at n=4096.
#   - The gate was BLIND to the failure, exactly as predicted: locked = 100.00%,
#     capture margin never negative (min +8.1 us, same as n=4096's +9.2 us), and
#     the corrupted cells' margins were indistinguishable from the clean ones
#     (median 185.4 us both). More settle_count could never have fixed this --
#     the gate gates on arrival, and arrival had stopped tracking content.
#   - Reproduced collapse: 65.9 ms/sweep (timing exactly as intended) with
#     S_repeat 16.5 dB and 42/499 visibly corrupted, against a same-day n=4096
#     bracket of 28.8-35.1 dB and ~35/1199.
#
# DEMOD_SAMPLES is how many of those samples _sweep_core correlates against the
# reference tone, and it is 2000 rather than 2048 for an unrelated reason. The
# demod is mean(iq * exp(-j2pi*cw_offset*t)) over N samples -- a rectangular
# window -- so its rejection of anything that is not the tone is a sinc with
# nulls every sample_rate/N. LO leakage sits at DC, cw_offset away from the tone,
# so the rejection of DC is set by how many whole tone cycles fit the window:
#   N = 4096 -> 40.96 cycles, DC lands near a null by luck   -> about -60 dB
#   N = 2048 -> 20.48 cycles, DC lands almost exactly BETWEEN -> about -36 dB
#   N = 2000 -> 20.00 cycles, DC lands ON a null (as does every odd harmonic)
# 2048 would therefore have been 24 dB worse at rejecting LO leakage, which is
# the worst case available. The condition is that cw_offset * N / sample_rate be
# an integer -- at 10 Msps and 100 kHz that is any multiple of 100. Verified at
# runtime before making the change: the server reports cw_offset exactly 100000
# and sample_rate exactly 10000000, both plain ints feeding both the TX waveform
# and this tone, so 2000 gives 20.000 cycles and not 20.000-ish.
#
# Dropping the 48 unused samples costs 10*log10(2048/2000) = 0.10 dB of
# processing gain, against a within-step noise term already 70.8 dB down on a
# system limited at ~40 dB. It is free.

          1 at T0+dwell, so T0's own boundary carries no transient: the train
          has a double-width gap and T0 sits in the middle of it.

          of its own smoothing window, so the position comes instead from
