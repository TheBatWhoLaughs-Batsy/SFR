"""Rover control server -- ws://0.0.0.0:9002.

    groundstation --ws:9002--> rover_server --ws:8765--> Arduino UNO R4

The Arduino is a WebSocket *client*: it dials into the Pi. This process is the
server for both links and is the only place rover calibration lives.

WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY MOST OF THIS FILE GOT SMALLER (2026-08-29)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The previous firmware ran its steppers from loop() and, so that WiFi would not
disturb them, refused to service the socket while moving. The board was deaf for
the whole duration of every move: it could not be stopped, could not be queried,
and silently discarded anything that arrived mid-move.

Everything this file used to do was a workaround for that. Click-and-hold was a
train of small discrete moves, because a continuous jog could not have been
stopped. Moves were paced by an *estimated* travel time so the board's buffer
could not overflow. An ack-grace timeout guessed at completion, and a heuristic
gave up on acks entirely for boards that never replied. Position was dead
reckoned from what we hoped had happened.

The firmware now steps from a timer ISR and stays responsive throughout, so all
of that is gone: `enforce_move_time`, `ack_grace_s`, `move_overhead_s`,
`ACK_GIVEUP`, the jog train, and the commanded-vs-confirmed split.

POSITION
--------
Position is no longer dead reckoned here at all. The board reports its own step
counter and this file converts it to mm. One coordinate frame end to end -- steps,
positive = up and right, origin wherever the operator last declared it -- so
there are no offsets to keep in sync. Axis direction sense moved into the
firmware (config.h V_DIR_INVERT / H_DIR_INVERT), which is why `invert_x` and
`invert_y` no longer exist here.

The remaining error sources are honest ones:

* **Quantisation.** Bounded, not accumulating: moves are commanded as ABSOLUTE
  step targets wherever possible, so the error is always <= half a step of the
  final position (65 um horizontally, 2.5 um vertically) no matter how many
  moves have been made. The old firmware rounded every RELATIVE move
  independently and discarded the remainder, which at a 1 mm jog quantum was a
  systematic +3.67% on the horizontal axis -- invisible at the coarse jog steps
  it was tested with, and 3.7 mm of error over a 100 mm raster.
* **Calibration.** The horizontal axis rolls on 66 mm wheels; its steps/mm is a
  measured quantity, and the effective rolling diameter under load is slightly
  under the caliper diameter. `rover_calibrate` corrects it from a commanded
  vs. measured distance. This is now the dominant horizontal error term.
* **Slip and missed steps.** Unobservable without an encoder. What we can do is
  report the odometer since the last declared position, which is the exposure.

Axis names: the groundstation says x (horizontal) and y (vertical); the board
says h and v. `BOARD_AXIS` is the only place that mapping lives.

        Two separate bugs live in the obvious `for c in self.clients: await
        c.send(msg)`, and this rig hits both.

        1. `client_handler` does `clients.add()` on connect and `.discard()` in
           its `finally`, on this same event loop -- so every `await` inside the
           loop is a yield point at which the set can be mutated underneath the
           iterator. That is `RuntimeError: Set changed size during iteration`,
           and because `broadcast()` is called from `board_handler` at 20 Hz it
           kills the BOARD link, not just one client. It became constant once
           the groundstation's reconnect dropped to 500 ms (useWebSocket.js).
           Iterating a snapshot is what fixes it; the set itself is only
           rebound, never mutated in place, after every send has finished.

        2. `send()` has no timeout and the sends were sequential, so one client
           that is not draining -- a wedged browser, or a half-open TCP with no
           FIN/RST -- blocks the whole loop and every other client with it. Same
           failure as `_send_to_all` in sdr_server.py; see CLAUDE.md.

        A client that cannot take a frame within `timeout` is dropped and left to
        reconnect. Note the rover raster's silent-link watchdog aborts a scan
        after STATUS_STALE_MS (4 s) without a status frame, so stalling here is
        not survivable -- dropping the slow client is the cheaper failure.
