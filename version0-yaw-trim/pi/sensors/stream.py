# a median run of 34 identical consecutive polls at ~584 Hz; and 17.2 Hz at
# 165 mm falling to 11.5 Hz at 340 mm, which is adaptive integration time, not a
# settable frame clock). Polling faster CANNOT produce more measurements.
#
# It is still polled fast, at 200 Hz, and that is deliberate: the poll rate does
# not set how many measurements exist, it sets how late we learn that one has
# appeared. At 20 Hz that was up to 50 ms, which on a hand-swept module at
# 25 mm/s is 1.25 mm of position error -- and a DIRECTION-DEPENDENT one, since
# the sign flips when the sweep reverses, so an out-and-back pass lays the same
# physical standoff down in two places. At 200 Hz it is 5 ms / 0.13 mm. The cost
# was measured at 584 Hz (2026-08-27) and is nil: broadcast 48.35 vs 48.79 Hz,
# IMU rate slightly BETTER at 33.83 vs 32.66 Hz.
#
# What makes that safe for everything downstream is that `seq` now counts
# MEASUREMENTS, not reads -- see lidar_poll_loop. Publishing 200 reads/s of a
# 14 Hz value would have inflated the groundstation's `lidar_n` and deflated
# `lidar_std` into fiction, which is exactly the trap the 20 Hz cap was avoiding.

# A poll whose value differs from the last is unambiguously a new measurement.
# The converse is not true: on a still target two genuine measurements can land
# on the same integer millimetre (raw sigma is 0.66-0.78 mm against 1 mm
# quantisation, so identical pairs run ~40%). Rather than undercount, a reading
# that has been stable for this long is republished as a new measurement -- it
# IS a current reading of a static target, so stamping it "now" is correct, and
# the case only arises when the true spread over the window really is ~zero.
# Chosen well above the slowest observed internal period (~87 ms at 11.5 Hz) so
# it cannot fire between two genuinely-new measurements.

    Polled at LIDAR_POLL_HZ (200), which is far above the sensor's own 11-17 Hz
    measurement rate ON PURPOSE -- see the constant for why: fast polling buys a
    tight TIMESTAMP for each measurement, not more of them.

    `seq` and `ts` therefore describe MEASUREMENTS, not reads. `seq` advances
    only when the value changes (or when a stable value ages past
    LIDAR_STABLE_REPUBLISH_S), and `ts` is stamped at that moment. This matters
    to every consumer: App.jsx dedupes accumulated readings by `lidar_seq`, so
    publishing every read at 200 Hz would have made `lidar_n` count duplicates
    and `lidar_std` measure the spread of a value repeated -- the "repeats
    deflate the spread" fiction the old 20 Hz cap existed to avoid. Counting
    measurements is both faster to timestamp AND more honest than the old
    per-read counter was at 20 Hz, where 20-40% of reads were already repeats.

    This is deliberately NOT awaited inline in sensor_loop's broadcast loop:
    TFLC02.read_distance() blocks on a 100ms UART timeout whenever the sensor
    doesn't answer, which happened to be true throughout the 2026-08-24
    debugging above. Awaiting it directly in the broadcast loop caps the whole
    stream (IMU included) at ~10Hz regardless of `rate` -- confirmed by timing
    read_distance() in isolation. Running it here, in its own task via
    run_in_executor, means a slow or dead LiDAR only slows *this* loop; the
    broadcast loop below keeps running at its full requested rate using
    whatever LiDAR reading was most recently published, stale or not."""
