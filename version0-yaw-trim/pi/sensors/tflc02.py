# Why a failed read carries a REASON rather than a bare None.
#
# Every one of these used to collapse into `None`, and that single fact is what
# made a LiDAR dropout undiagnosable from anywhere in the system -- no Pi log,
# no field on the wire, no panel readout could tell "the sensor is replying
# normally and says it cannot range the target" from "the sensor is dead".
# Measured 2026-09-11 on the bench: total dropouts of 9-22 s during which the
# UART stayed perfectly healthy (177.6 commands/s out, 177.9 replies/s back,
# zero frame/parity/overrun errors per TIOCGICOUNT) -- so the failure was
# entirely in the payload, and nothing recorded which payload.
#
# The two classes need opposite responses, which is the whole point of
# separating them:
#   SENSOR_*  -- the link works and the module answered. A sustained run of
#                these is a SIGHTING problem (target out of range, too oblique,
#                too dark, ambient IR). Aim the head, do not re-check cables.
#   LINK_*    -- the module did not answer, or answered with something that is
#                not a frame. That is the wiring/power/baud class, and it is the
#                one the 2026-08-24 investigation chased at length.

# The module reports "I cannot measure this" as a literal distance of 8888 with a
# non-zero error code. Measured 2026-09-11 over 33,825 failing reads pointed across
# a room: codes 4, 6, 20, 22 and 54 ALL returned exactly 8888 and nothing else, while
# 43,158 in-range reads returned real distances with code 0 and never 8888. So the
# sentinel -- not the code -- is the reliable discriminator, and no usable measurement
# is being thrown away when a non-zero code is rejected.
#
# This is worth naming separately rather than lumping in with the other failures,
# because it is NOT a fault: the sensor is working and the target is simply beyond
# what it can reach. Reported as `oor:<code>` so the code is still visible (the bits
# differ between an isolated miss and a sustained out-of-range run) while the common
# case reads plainly in a log.
