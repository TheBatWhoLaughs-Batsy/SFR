// ── Timing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Step pulses are generated in a fixed-frequency timer ISR, so WiFi servicing
// in the main loop can never disturb them -- the whole reason the previous
// firmware had to go deaf while moving.
//
// 20 kHz gives 50 us per tick. The budget is set by digitalWrite, which costs
// roughly a microsecond on this core: a worst-case tick writes 4 step pins low,
// 4 high (the horizontal axis has three ganged motors) and up to 2 direction
// pins, so ~10 us of a 50 us budget. Direct port writes would allow a faster
// ISR; that is the upgrade path if step timing ever proves rough.
//
// The fastest axis needs 5000 steps/s (vertical at 25 mm/s) = 4 ticks per step,
// so an individual interval can quantise by up to 25%. The phase accumulator
// keeps the AVERAGE rate exact regardless, and average rate is what position
// depends on -- a stepper's mechanical time constant absorbs the rest.
#define ISR_HZ 20000.0f

// Ramp updates (accelerate / decelerate / limit checks) run inside the same ISR
// but only every ISR_HZ/RAMP_HZ ticks, so the trapezoid costs little.

// ── Safety ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#define JOG_WATCHDOG_MS 500

// Below this speed a decelerating axis is simply stopped, and a move still
// short of its target creeps at this rate rather than approaching it
// asymptotically -- that is what guarantees it lands on the exact step.
#define MIN_SPEED_STEPS_S 20.0f

// A static IP sidesteps DHCP entirely. Uncomment and set these if the board ever
// associates but fails to get a lease -- the classic symptom is that it works
// until it is power-cycled and then only comes back after a ROUTER restart,
// because the AP is still holding a stale lease for its MAC. Pick an address
// outside the AP's DHCP pool (the Pi's sfr-pi network hands out 10.42.0.10-254,
// so .2-.9 are free; the Pi itself is 10.42.0.1 and is also the gateway).

// ── Network recovery ladder ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// See the long note above serviceNetwork() in rover.ino for why this is a
// ladder. In short: WiFi.status() is the modem's opinion of itself, it latches
// at WL_CONNECTED after the AP goes away without a clean deauth, and a firmware
// that trusts it can never re-associate. Each rung below is only reached when
// every rung above it has already failed.

// Rung 1. If the WebSocket stays down this long while WiFi claims to be up, the
// client is assumed wedged and is torn down and restarted. Without this, a
// rover_server restart on the Pi -- which happens routinely during development
// -- can leave the board sitting there with a live WiFi link and a socket that
// never comes back.
#define WS_RECONNECT_FORCE_MS 10000

// Rung 2. After this many fruitless socket restarts, stop believing the status
// register and ask the network itself (see NET_USE_PING). ~30 s at the interval
// above, which is comfortably longer than any legitimate reconnect.
#define NET_RECYCLE_AFTER_TRIES 3

// Ask the DEFAULT GATEWAY whether the network is real, rather than trusting
// WiFi.status(). This is what separates "the Pi is switched off" (gateway
// answers -- an everyday state, do nothing but keep knocking) from "the radio
// is wedged" (gateway silent while the modem insists it is connected).
//
// Set to 0 if WiFi.ping() is unavailable on the installed core. The ladder still
// works without it, but it can no longer tell those two apart and will recycle
// the radio -- and eventually reset the board -- whenever the Pi is off.

// ── Yaw trim: differential drive of the rear wheels (added 2.5.0) ───────────
// Wheel layout, like an auto-rickshaw: one wheel in front, two at the rear.
//   socket Y (pins 2/5)   = FRONT wheel (single)
//   socket Z (pins 4/7)   = REAR RIGHT wheel
//   socket A (pins 12/13) = REAR LEFT wheel
// All three are driven; none steers. The chassis yaws when the two rear wheels
// turn at different rates, so a persistent drift away from parallel is
// corrected by running one rear wheel a little faster than the other. The
// front wheel and the position count both run at the BASE rate, so trim never
// disturbs the odometry -- the front wheel scrubs slightly instead.
//
// Trim is a signed percentage of that base rate, pushed by the Pi in `cfg` as
// "yaw", or on its own with the `trim` command (which is what the closed loop
// in pi/rover/yaw_control.py uses, a few times a second while moving). The Pi
// persists it; the board does not. Convention:
//   yaw > 0  ->  LEFT rear (A) faster, RIGHT rear (Z) slower  ->  nose turns RIGHT
//   yaw < 0  ->  the opposite                                 ->  nose turns LEFT
