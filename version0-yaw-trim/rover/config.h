// vertical sense is flipped here and the horizontal one is not. Previously this
// lived on the Pi as invert_x/invert_y; it belongs here, so that step counts on
// the wire mean the same thing to everyone.

// ── Timing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Step pulses are generated in a fixed-frequency timer ISR, so WiFi servicing
// in the main loop can never disturb them -- the whole reason the previous
// firmware had to go deaf while moving.
//
// 20 kHz gives 50 us per tick. The budget is set by digitalWrite, which costs
// roughly a microsecond on this core: a worst-case tick writes 4 step pins low,
// 4 high (the horizontal axis has three ganged motors) and up to 2 direction
// pins, so ~10 us of a 50 us budget. Direct port writes would allow a faster
// ISR; that is the upgrade path if step timing ever proves rough.
//
// The fastest axis needs 5000 steps/s (vertical at 25 mm/s) = 4 ticks per step,
// so an individual interval can quantise by up to 25%. The phase accumulator
// keeps the AVERAGE rate exact regardless, and average rate is what position
// depends on -- a stepper's mechanical time constant absorbs the rest.
#define ISR_HZ 20000.0f

// Ramp updates (accelerate / decelerate / limit checks) run inside the same ISR
// but only every ISR_HZ/RAMP_HZ ticks, so the trapezoid costs little.

// Below this speed a decelerating axis is simply stopped, and a move still
// short of its target creeps at this rate rather than approaching it
// asymptotically -- that is what guarantees it lands on the exact step.

// A static IP sidesteps DHCP entirely. Uncomment and set these if the board ever

// Trim is a signed percentage of the base rate, pushed by the Pi in `cfg` as
